# Budg-it

A simple zero-based budgeting tool which aims to take the pain out of tracking your finances. It focuses on automating the tedious parts of personal finance, such as recurring transactions, saving for financial goals, and importing bank transactions. All the while, it's self-hosted and privacy-first, so you don't need to worry about bad actors harvesting your financial data.

## Next Steps

1. Start first integration with Bank
  - Test out the adaptor pattern required
  - Get used to OAuth
  - Useful to see how Bank APIs have modeled their resources and APIs, copy ~~good~~ (turns out, bank APIs kinda suck) practices
2. Fill out remaining resources
  - Payee
  - Category
3. Build up storage layer
4. Add domain validation
5. Build out journeys
  - Account management
  - Importing transactions  
6. Start zero-based budgeting logic
  - Assign funds to categories
  - Create targets
7. Wrap this in Docker
