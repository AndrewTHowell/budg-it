# Budg-it

A simple zero-based budgeting tool which aims to take the pain out of tracking your finances. It focuses on automating the tedious parts of personal finance, such as recurring transactions, saving for financial goals, and importing bank transactions. All the while, it's self-hosted and privacy-first, so you don't need to worry about bad actors harvesting your financial data.
